Project README: Apate
Introduction
Welcome to Apate - a high-efficiency data generation tool designed to rapidly produce large volumes of data and database schema operations with controllable proportions. Apate empowers QA teams by significantly improving testing efficiency, achieving nearly 100% utilization of test cases. This README provides an overview of the project, its features, and how to use it effectively.

Features
Efficient Data Generation
Rapidly generates large amounts of data and DDL (Data Definition Language) operations.
Can perform 100,000 database schema changes in less than 15 seconds, ensuring swift iterations during testing phases.
Real-time Progress Monitoring
Utilizes performance monitoring and logging mechanisms to provide real-time insights into data generation progress.
Enables QA teams to track progress efficiently and make informed decisions.
Flexible Configuration Options
Offers a rich set of global configuration options, allowing adjustment of parameters such as DDL operation proportions, transaction management, and write strategies.
Tailors to diverse testing scenarios (e.g., orders, e-commerce, messaging) without the need for script rewriting, saving up to 1 day of manual effort per iteration.
